# AWS Training
<a id="top" />

This is my personal summary in the way to take AWS Certifications. I learn mainly from:
* [Cloudac Ademy Site](https://cloudacademy.com).
* [A Cloud Guru Site](https://acloud.guru/)
* [AWS Training and CertiÔ¨Åcation Site](https://www.aws.training/)

Open an account at [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) making almost everything with the [Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)
