### Quick Explanation Of The S3 Consistency Model
[codeburst link](https://codeburst.io/quick-explanation-of-the-s3-consistency-model-6c9f325e3f82)

Amazon S3 provides **read-after-write consistency for PUTS of new objects** in your S3 bucket in all regions with one caveat. The caveat is that if you make a HEAD or GET request to the key name (to find if the object exists) before creating the object, Amazon S3 provides eventual consistency for read-after-write.

* Example 1
```
  PUT /key-prefix/cool-file.jpg 200
  GET /key-prefix/cool-file.jpg 200 (read-after-write)
```
* Example 2
```
  PUT /key-prefix/cool-file.jpg 200
  PUT /key-prefix/cool-file.jpg 200 (new content)
  GET /key-prefix/cool-file.jpg 200 (eventual consistency - old or new content)
```
* Example 3
```
  GET /key-prefix/cool-file.jpg 404
  PUT /key-prefix/cool-file.jpg 200
  GET /key-prefix/cool-file.jpg 404  (eventual consistency)
```

### User names for AMIs
* For an Amazon Linux AMI, the user name is `ec2-user`.
* For a RHEL AMI, the user name is `ec2-user` or `root`.
* For an Ubuntu AMI, the user name is `ubuntu` or `root`.
* For a Centos AMI, the user name is `centos`.
* For a Debian AMI, the user name is `admin` or `root`.
* For a Fedora AMI, the user name is `ec2-user`.
* For a SUSE AMI, the user name is `ec2-user` or `root`.

### Spot Instances Costs

* First Hour
  - By Amazon: you will not be charged
  - By you: charged to the nearest second
* All other hours
  - By Amazon: charged to the nearest second
  - By you: charged to the nearest second
* On Windows stopped By you: full hour.

### EC2 default Metrics on CLoudWatch
* Memory utilization
* disk swap utilization
* disk space utilization
* page file utilization
* log collection

### Amazon API Gateway Throttling Limits
* Levels
  - Global
  - By Service call
* Types
  - Standard Rates
  - Burst
* Example  
  1.000 request/second toa specific method and ...  
  all the API to a burst of 2.000/second for a few seconds.  
* Any requests over the limit will receive a 429 HTTP response
* The client SDKs generated by Amazon API Gateway **retry calls automatically** when met with this response

### EBS Changes
* If no classic generation ... you can without detaching it from the instance:
  - Increase its size
  - Change its volume type
  - Adjust its IOPS (for an io1 volume)

### EBS Snapshots
When you take a snapshot of an attached Amazon EBS volume that is in use, the snapshot excludes data cached by applications or the operating system. For a **single EBS volume**, this is often not a problem. However, when cached data is excluded from snapshots of **multiple EBS volumes in a RAID array**, restoring the volumes from the snapshots can degrade the integrity of the array.

### Standard RAID levels
[wiki link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_RAID_levels)
* RAID 0  
  - Block-level striping without parity or mirroring
  - Speed no redundancy
* RAID 1  
  - Mirroring without parity or striping
* RAID 2  
  - Bit-level striping with Hamming code for error correction
  - Rarely used
* RAID 3  
  - Byte-level striping with dedicated parity
  - Rarely used
* RAID 4  
  - Block-level striping with dedicated parity
  - good performance of random reads, low for random writes  
* RAID 5  
  - Block-level striping with distributed parity
  - at least three disks
* RAID 6
  - Block-level striping with double distributed parity 

### Access Keys and Key Pairs
[aws link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html)
* Access Keys    
  Access keys consist of an access key ID (for example, AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE) and a secret access key (for example, wJYEXAMPLEKEY...).   
  You use access keys to sign programmatic requests that you make to AWS if you use the AWS SDKs, REST, or Query API operations.
* Key Pairs  
  Key pairs consist of a public key and a private key. You use the private key to create a digital signature, and then AWS uses the corresponding public key to validate the signature. Key pairs are used only for Amazon EC2 and Amazon CloudFront.  

### ENI attachment
* Hot attach: instance is running
* Warm attach: instance is stopped
* Cold attach: instance is being launched

### DR - Disaster Recovery
* Concpets RTO & RPO
* Backup/Restore
* Pilot Light
* Warm Standby
* Multisite

### ECS Launch Types
[aws link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/launch_types.html)
* Fargate Launch Type. Fully managed
* EC2 Launch Type. You managed
