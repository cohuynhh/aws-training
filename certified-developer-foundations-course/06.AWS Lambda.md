Example  
You could create a lambda function to execute every time an image is uploaded to a particular bucket in S3 which will then compress the image into a zip format.  
This function will be trigged upon a PUT request to the bucket.  

Languages
* Node.js
* Java
* C#
* Python

#### Compute power costs
- EC2 charges for compute time per hour
- AWS Lambda charges for compute time used to the closet 100ms plus the number of requests

**Very cheap compute option for run event-driven code**

#### Lambda Function
* Required resources. ram
* Max exec timeout
* IAM role
* Handler name
* Triggers
	* S3
	* DynamoDB
	* CloudFront
	* API Gateway

#### Lambda Function creation flow
* Select a blueprint. ex. s3-get-object
* Configure Triggers
* Configure Functions. Upload code or edit it

**KEY BENEFIT**  
**It is a highly scalable serverless service and cost optimized**
