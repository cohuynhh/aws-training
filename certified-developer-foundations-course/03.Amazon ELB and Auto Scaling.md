## Amazon ELB and Auto Scaling

### ELB. Elastic Load Balancing
High availability and resilience

#### Classic Load Balancer
Routes traffic based on app and network information

* Multiple Web Serves example
* Even in more than one Availability Zone (AZ)
* Setting up steps: 
	* Define ELB
      - External Load Balancer   
        Public IP adderss, data from inet (Route 53)
	  - Internal Load Balancer  
	    Internal IP, mongoDB shards example
    * Select at least 2 Availability Zones
    * ELB Listener Configuration. http/s, tcp & ssl
	* Add Security Groups
	* Configure Security Settings  
	  For https you need to deploy a SSL certificate, checking before to send to a EC2 instance
	* Configure Health Checks  
	  A ping to the instance
	* Add EC2 instances
	* Add Tags

#### Auto Scaling

* How its work  
For example at 75% of CPU ussage you can deploy another EC2 instance **(scale out)** and reduce **(scale in)**  when the demand has drop.
	* Automatic insfraestructure management (no manual steps)
	* Better user experience
	* Reduce costs
	* No downtime deploy
	* You can attach ELB to a "Auto Scaling Group" of EC2 instances
* Auto Scaling Configuration
	* Launch Configuration  
	  Template to launch new instances. AMI, instance type, IP address, storage, user data, sec groups, etc.
    - Auto Scaling Group  
      Defines scaling policies  
      Defines where place resources (AZ)
	  
Demonstration

#### Application Load Balancer
Routes traffic catering for multiple apps on the same EC2 instance
Nothing said :(


#### Labs Recommended
* Creating your first Classic Load Balancer
* Creating your first Auto Scaling group
* Launching Auto scaling groups behind a Classic Load Balancer
