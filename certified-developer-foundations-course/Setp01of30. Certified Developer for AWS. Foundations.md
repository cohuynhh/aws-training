# Compute

## Amazon EC2

### AMI
Amazon Machine Image  
Origins: Amazon, Customs & Market Place

### Instance Types

Resources:   
CPU, Memory, Storage & Networking

* Genral Purpose  
Balanced resources  
Ideal for small-med apps, ddbb, test&dev environments
- Compute Optimized  
Front-end, web servers, science apps
- GPU  
Graphic processing unit, graphic-intensive apps  
- Memory optimized  
large-scale, enterprise-class, in-mem apps
- Storage Optimized  
SSD backed for low latency and high I/O perfromance  
Analytic workload, no sql ddbb, data file systems & lock processing apps

### Instance Purchasing Options

* On-Demand instances  
	- Flat rate & pay per hour  
	- Launched at any time for as long as needed.  
	- Irregular uninterruptable workloads  
	- Test & Dev enverinments  

* Reserved Instances
	- Purchased fro a set period of time for a reduced cost (till 75%)
	- Best appllied for long term, predicateble workloads
	- Discounts
		- Pay all upfront: 1 to 3 years regardless the number of hours the instance is used
		- Partial upfront: smaller upfront for smaller discount
		- No upfront: the smallest discount is applied

* Spot Instances
	- Bid for a large EC2 instance at a very low price
	- No guarantee of having it
	- Can suddenly be terminated 
	- Are only useful for processing data and apps that can be suddenly interrupted, batch jobs and background processing data
	- Just pay for running time

* Dedicated Instances
	- Next item
* Dedicated Hosts
	- Next item


### Tenancy

* Shared
	- launched on any available host with required resources 
	- multiple customers at the same host
	- Security mechanisms prevent accessing one each other
* Dedicated Instances
	- launched on hardware that no other customer can access
	- incur additional charges 
* Dedicated Hosts
	- The same that dedicated instances with additional visibility and control of the physical host


NOTE  
Recommend share tenancy for costs except to comply with a regulation


### User Data
* Allows to run commands at boot time
* Perform functions upon boot
* Download latest OS updates (yum update -y)


### Storage Options
* Persistent Storage
	- ESB: Elastic Block Storage
	- Phisically separated from the EC2 instance
	- ESB are network attached to EC2
	- Replicate to other zone for resiliency
	- You can disconnect for EC2 & reattach to another EC2 instance
	- You can encrypt & backup snapshots to a simple storage service S3

* Ephemeral Storage
	- Create by some EC2 instances themselves  
	  Known as instance backed storage
    - Attached to EC2 instance
    - When instance stopped all data on disk is lost
    - NOTE: If you reboot all data WILL remain (not if you stopped)
    - Unable to detach

### Security

* Security Group  
Is a firewall for the instance, allowing restrict traffic for ingress and egress perspective
	- Source and destination restriction
	- Inbound and outbound rules
	- Ports and protocols usage
	- [Blog Security Group  - Instance Level Security](https://cloudacademy.com/blog/aws-security-groups-instance-level-security/)

* Key Pairs
	- Public Key: encrypts username & password
	- Private Key
		- 	On Windows decrypt data and gain access to credentials
		- 	On Linux remotely connect onto the instance via SSH
	- After first log in you can set up your own authentication methods
	- Keep your OS patched & security fixes uo to date (your responsability)

### EC2 Dashboard Status Checks

* System Statush Checks
	- Issues relating to the underlying host
	- Loss of power, network connectivity, hardware and software on the host
	- Faulty components that are under AWS responsability
	- Stop and restart the instance (Don't reboot.. occurs in the same host)
* Instance Status Checks
	- Issues with the EC2 instance itself
	- Incorrect network configuration, corrupt files, exhausted memory, incomp kernel
	- Requires the instance owner to troubleshoot and resolve th issue

## Amazon ELB and Auto Scaling

### ELB. Elastic Load Balancing
High availability and resilience

#### Classic Load Balancer
Routes traffic based on app and network information

* Multiple Web Serves example
* Even in more than one Availability Zone (AZ)
* Setting up steps: 
	* Define ELB
      - External Load Balancer   
        Public IP adderss, data from inet (Route 53)
	  - Internal Load Balancer  
	    Internal IP, mongoDB shards example
    * Select at least 2 Availability Zones
    * ELB Listener Configuration. http/s, tcp & ssl
	* Add Security Groups
	* Configure Security Settings  
	  For https you need to deploy a SSL certificate, checking before to send to a EC2 instance
	* Configure Health Checks  
	  A ping to the instance
	* Add EC2 instances
	* Add Tags

#### Auto Scaling

* How its work  
For example at 75% of CPU ussage you can deploy another EC2 instance **(scale out)** and reduce **(scale in)**  when the demand has drop.
	* Automatic insfraestructure management (no manual steps)
	* Better user experience
	* Reduce costs
	* No downtime deploy
	* You can attach ELB to a "Auto Scaling Group" of EC2 instances
* Auto Scaling Configuration
	* Launch Configuration  
	  Template to launch new instances. AMI, instance type, IP address, storage, user data, sec groups, etc.
    - Auto Scaling Group  
      Defines scaling policies  
      Defines where place resources (AZ)
	  
Demonstration

#### Application Load Balancer
Routes traffic catering for multiple apps on the same EC2 instance

## Amazon ECS

***Amazon EC2 Container Service***

* Run docker-enabled apps across a cluster of EC2 instances  
* ECS abstract the cluster management by passing the responsability over to the service itself  
* Docker and Container
* ECS removes the need to manage the cluster management system
* There is no need to install any management or monitoring software
* AWS CloudWatch monitors metrics against containers and clusters

Amazon ECS Cluster
* Cluster act as a resource pool
* Clusters are dynamically scalable and multiple instances can be used
* Clusters can only scale in a single region
* Containers can be scheduled to be deployed across your cluster
* Instances within the cluster also have a Docker daemon and an ECS agent

## AWS Lambda

Run code in response to events in a **serverless** environment

Relatred Course at ...  
https://cloudacademy.com/amazon-web-services/what-is-serverless-computing-course/

Example  
You could create a lambda function to execute every time an image is uploaded to a particular bucket in S3 which will then compress the image into a zip format.  
This function will be trigged upon a PUT request to the bucket.  

Languages
* Node.js
* Java
* C#
* Python

#### Compute power costs
- EC2 charges for compute time per hour
- AWS Lambda charges for compute time used to the closet 100ms plus the number of requests

**Very cheap compute option for run event-driven code**

#### Lambda Function
* Required resources. ram
* Max exec timeout
* IAM role
* Handler name
* Triggers
	* S3
	* DynamoDB
	* CloudFront
	* API Gateway

#### Lambda Function creation flow
* Select a blueprint. ex. s3-get-object
* Configure Triggers
* Configure Functions. Upload code or edit it

**KEY BENEFIT**  
**It is a highly scalable serverless service and cost optimized**

#### Job Queues
* Possible multiple queues with different priorities
* On-demand and spot instances are supported by queues

#### Job Scheduling
* Takes care of when a Job should be run and from which compute environment
* Typically first-in-first-out
* Ensures that higher priority queues are run first

#### Compute Environments
* Managed Environments (by AWS)
* Unmanaged Environments (by You)

**Use cases**  
Run multiple jobs in parallel using batch computing for ex to analyze financial risk models, perform media transcoding or engineering simulations.
