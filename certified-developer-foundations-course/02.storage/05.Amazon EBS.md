## Amazon EBS
Elastic Block Store for EC2 instances

* Intro
  * Replicated within a AZ
  * off-instances
  * attached to EC2 instance, ramain inctact on desacttach
  * physically written with zeroes on delete
  * you can encrypt data manually or automatic
* Encryption
  * Advanced AES-253 by amazon
  * Occurs within EC2 instance
* Snapshots
  * point in time snapshot, then replicated to S3 multiple AZ
  * from snapshot you can create a new EBS
  * Are incremental
  * EBS tied to a AZ, snapshot to the Region
  * Billed ny increments
  * IMplement LAzy loading, you can use immediatly
  * You can share snapshot
  * Create a EBS from Snapshot you can increase the size
* Volume Types
  * Magnetic
    * Access infrequently
	* Low-cost small size
	* 100 IOPS average
	* 1 GB to 1 TB
  * General Purpose SSD
    * Cost-effective
	* 1 digit millisecond latencies
	* Burst to 3.000 IOPS for extende periods of time
	* Baseline 3 IOPS per GB
	  * Minimun 100 IOPS (at 33.33 GB)
	  * Maximun 10.000 IOPS at 3.334 GB and above
	* 1 GB to 16 TB
  * Provisioned SSD
    * I/O intensive workload. eg. DDBB
	* 4 GB to 16 TB
	* up to 20.000 IOPS per volume
	* ratio IOPS to size can be max 30
	  - ex. 3.000 IOPS must be at least 100 GB
	* Multiple volumes on RAID
  * (st1) Throughput Optimized HDD
    * Low-cost throughput rather thank IOPS
	* Good for large sequential workload such as Amazon EMR, ETL, data warehouse and log processing
	* Bootable st1 vaolumes are not supported
  * (sc1) Cold HDD
    * Low-cosr throughput over IOPS
	* sc1 large sequential cold-data workload
	* sc1 provides inexpensive block store
	* bootable not supported

* Performance Considreations
  * st1 scan quickly (up to 500 MiB/s)
  * Or several full volume scans a day
  * sc1 infrequently access, no more than 250 MB/s
  * Both performance consistenly 90% of burst throughput 99% of the time
  * Use for straming and big data
