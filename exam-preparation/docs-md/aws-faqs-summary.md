## FAQs ACM (Amazon Certificate Manager)
* To use an ACM certificate with Amazon CloudFront, you must request the certificate in the US East (N. Virginia) region. ACM certificates in this region that are associated with a CloudFront distribution are distributed to all the geographic locations configured for that distribution.
* Can I use certificates on Amazon EC2 instances or on my own servers? No.
* Does ACM support checking of DNS Certificate Authority Authorization (CAA) records? Yes. DNS Certificate Authority Authorization (CAA) records allow domain owners to specify which certificate authorities are authorized to issue certificates for their domain. When you request an ACM Certificate, AWS Certificate Manager looks for a CAA record in the DNS zone configuration for your domain. If a CAA record is not present, then Amazon can issue a certificate for your domain. Most customers fall into this category. If your DNS configuration contains a CAA record, that record must specify one of the following CAs before Amazon can issue a certificate for your domain: amazon.com, amazontrust.com,
* Q: Does ACM support checking of DNS Certificate Authority Authorization (CAA) records? Yes. DNS Certificate Authority Authorization (CAA) records allow domain owners to specify which certificate authorities are authorized to issue certificates for their domain. When you request an ACM Certificate, AWS Certificate Manager looks for a CAA record in the DNS zone configuration for your domain.

If your DNS configuration contains a CAA record, that record must specify one of the following CAs before Amazon can issue a certificate for your domain: amazon.com, amazontrust.com, awstrust.com, or amazonaws.com.
* Q. Why does ACM use CNAME records for DNS validation instead of TXT records? Using a CNAME record allows ACM to renew certificates for as long as the CNAME record exists. The CNAME record directs to a TXT record in an AWS domain (acm-validations.aws) that ACM can update as needed to validate or re-validate a domain name, without any action from you.
* Q: Does ACM provide Organizational Validation (OV) or Extended Validation (EV) certificates? Not at this time. Q: Does ACM provide certificates for anything other than SSL/TLS for websites? Not at this time. Q: Can I use certificates provided by ACM for code signing or email encryption? No.
* Q: How do I revoke a certificate? You can request ACM to revoke a certificate by visiting the AWS Support Center and creating a case.
* ACM certificates are only copied across Regions if the certificate is associated with a CloudFront distribution. In that case, CloudFront distributes the ACM certificate to the geographic locations configured for your distribution.
* Q: Can I audit the use of certificate private keys? Yes. Using AWS CloudTrail you can review logs that tell you when the private key for the certificate was used.
* Q: What is the validity period for certificates provided by ACM? Certificates provided by ACM are currently valid for 13 months.
* Q: Does ACM allow local language characters in domain names, otherwise known as Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs)? ACM does not allow Unicode encoded local language characters; however, ACM allows ASCII-encoded local language characters for domain names.
* Q: Will I be notified before my certificate is renewed and the new certificate is deployed? No. ACM may renew or rekey the certificate and replace the old one without prior notice.
* Q: Does my site drop existing connections when ACM deploys the renewed certificate? No, connections established after the new certificate is deployed use the new certificate, and existing connections are not affected.

## FAQs Cognito
* Cognito Identity also enables you to customize workflows by, for example, adding app-specific logic to user registration for fraud detection and user validation through AWS Lambda.
* Q: Can I have my own identity provider to support user sign-up and sign-in? Yes, you can easily and securely add sign-up and sign-in functionality to your apps with Cognito Identity. Your users can sign-up and sign-in using email, phone number, or user name. You can also implement enhanced security features, such as email verification, phone number verification, and multi-factor authentication. Cognito Identity also enables you to customize workflows by, for example, adding app-specific logic to user registration for fraud detection and user validation through AWS Lambda. To learn more, visit our docs.
* Q: Do I still need my own backend authentication systems with Cognito Identity? No. Cognito Identity supports login through Amazon, Facebook, Twitter, Digits, and Google, as well as providing support for unauthenticated users. With Cognito Identity you can support federated authentication, profile data sync store and AWS access token distribution without writing any backend code.
* Q: Does Cognito Identity support separate identities for different users on the same device? Yes. Cognito Identity supports separate identities on a single device, such as a family iPad. Each identity is treated separately and you have complete control over how your app logs users in and out and how local and remote app data is stored.
* Q: How much does Cognito Identity cost? With Amazon Cognito, you pay only for what you use. There are no minimum fees and no upfront commitments. If you are using the Cognito Identity to create a User Pool, you pay based on your monthly active users (MAUs) only. A user is counted as a MAU if within a calendar month there is an identity operation related to that user, such as sign-up, sign-in, token refresh, and password change. You are not charged for subsequent sessions or for inactive users with in that calendar month. Separate charges apply for optional use of SMS messaging as described below. The Your User Pool feature has a free tier of 50,000 MAUs each month. The Cognito Identity free tier does not expire at the end of your 12 month AWS Free Tier term, and it is available to both existing and new AWS customers indefinitely Federated Identities and secure access control for AWS resources are always free with Cognito Identity.
* Q: Does every write or read from the app count as a sync operation? No. You decide when to call the synchronize() method. Every write or read from the device is to the local SQlite store. This way you are in complete control of your costs.
* Q: Is data saved directly to the Amazon Cognito sync store? No. The optional AWS Mobile SDK saves your data to an SQLite database on the local device, this way the data is always accessible to your app. The data is pushed to the Amazon Cognito sync store by calling the synchronize() method and, if push synchronization is enabled, all other devices linked to an identity are notified of the data change in the sync store via Amazon SNS.

## FAQs WorkSpaces
* Q: Can I migrate users from an Amazon WorkSpaces Windows 7 bundle to a Windows 10 bundle? No. To offer existing users a Windows 10 desktop experience, you need to delete their existing Amazon WorkSpace and create a new one using a Windows 10 WorkSpaces bundle. To migrate data and documents, we recommend that you use the sync feature available with Amazon WorkDocs. Note that Amazon WorkDocs comes with 50GB of free storage for every Amazon WorkSpace.
* Q: What does a user need to use an Amazon Workspace? A user needs to have an Amazon WorkSpace provisioned for them, and a broadband Internet connection. To use an Amazon WorkSpaces client application to access their WorkSpace, they will need a supported client device (PC, Mac, iPad, Kindle Fire, or Android tablet), and an Internet connection with TCP ports 443 & 4172, and UDP port 4172 open.
* Q: If I am located a significant distance from the region where my Amazon WorkSpace is located, will I have a good user experience? If you are located more than 2000 miles from the regions where Amazon WorkSpaces is currently available, you can still use the service, but your experience may be less responsive. The easiest way to check performance is to use the Amazon WorkSpaces Connection Health Check Website. You can also refer to the Regional Products and Services page for details of Amazon WorkSpaces service availability by region.
* Q: Will encryption impact the launch time of an Amazon WorkSpace? The launch time of a WorkSpace that only requires user volume encryption are similar to those of an unencrypted WorkSpace. The launch time of a WorkSpace that requires root volume encrypt will take several more minutes.
* Q: What is the Amazon WorkDocs sync client? The Amazon WorkDocs sync client is a client application that you can install on your Amazon WorkSpace, which continuously, automatically, and securely syncs documents from your Amazon WorkSpace to your Amazon WorkDocs location. You can also install the Amazon WorkDocs sync client on a Mac or PC to sync documents across all desktops they may be using. When an Amazon WorkSpace is launched, users will have a link on their desktop so that they can install the Amazon WorkDocs sync client. The client can be downloaded here
* Q: How do I upload my applications to Amazon WAM? You can package your applications using the Amazon WAM Studio, validate using the Amazon WAM Player, and then upload your applications to Amazon WAM. For more information, see the Amazon WAM User Guide on packaging and validating.
* Q: Can I use any other client (e.g., an RDP client) with Amazon WorkSpaces? No. You can use any of the free clients provided by AWS,
* Q: Can I use PCoIP Zero Clients with Amazon WorkSpaces? Yes, Amazon WorkSpaces supports PCoIP Zero Client devices that have the Teradici Tera2 chipset. For a complete list of Zero Clients that are compatible with Amazon WorkSpaces please visit the device finder here (site hosted by Teradici).

* Q: Can I provide more than one Amazon Workspace per user? No. You can currently only provide one WorkSpace for each user.
* Q: What is the network bandwidth that I need to use my Amazon WorkSpace? The bandwidth needed to use your WorkSpace depends on what you're doing on your WorkSpace. For general office productivity use, we recommend that a bandwidth download speed of between 300Kbps up and 1Mbps. For graphics intensive work we recommend bandwidth download speeds of 3Mbps.
* Q: What is the maximum network latency recommended while accessing a Workspace? While the remoting protocol has a maximum round trip latency recommendation of 250 ms, the best user experience will be achieved at less than 100 ms.
* Q: What does the Amazon WorkSpaces Application Manager (Amazon WAM) cost? Amazon WAM is available in two versions - lite or standard. The Amazon WAM lite subscription is available at no charge, and the Amazon WAM standard subscription costs $5/user/month. You can learn more about Amazon WAM here.

* Understanding Your Usage with Billing Reports.
* Q: Can I connect Amazon WorkSpaces to my VPC? Yes. The first time you connect to the WorkSpaces Management Console, you can choose an easy ‘getting started’ link that will create a new VPC and two associated subnets for you as well as an Internet Gateway and a directory to contain your users. If you choose to access the console directly, you can choose which of your VPCs your WorkSpaces will connect to. If you have a VPC with a VPN connection back to your on-premises network, then your WorkSpaces will be able to communicate with your on-premises network (you retain the usual control you have over network access within your VPC using all of the normal configuration options such as security groups, network ACLS, and routing tables).
* Q: Will I be able to monitor how many hours my Amazon WorkSpaces have been running? Yes, you will be able to monitor the total number hours your Amazon WorkSpaces has been running in a given period of time through Amazon CloudWatch “UserConnected” metric.
* Q: Can I print from my tablet or Chromebook? The Amazon WorkSpaces clients for tablets and Chromebook support cloud printing services including, but not limited to, Cortado ThinPrint® and Google Cloud Print. Local and network printing are not currently supported.
